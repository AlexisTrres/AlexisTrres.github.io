## TEN SECONDS MATH

Ten Seconds Math is a game created by Michael Jakob to challenge a person's mathematical skills against the clock.  
In this project, I made my own version of this game changing some of it's features.

#### **Features**

- At the beginning, the user has 10 seconds to answer the math problem.

- The user chooses what type/s of math operations they will face: addition, substraction, multiplication or division.

- The user can limite the maximum number will appear.

- The most dificult operations provides more points (4 point for each division, 3 for multiplication, 2 for substraction and 1 for addition).

- The clock will start running once the first question is showed.

- The current question must be correctly answered to be allowed to answer the next.

- Every correct answer will add 10 seconds more to the clock.

- The user loses the game when the time is up! Don't let the clock run out!

#### **Usage**

To run the game in local, I have included Serve, a local server from an NPM library. 

Requeriments:

- node.js

- npm

Steps to open the server:

- Clone or download the repository in your computer.

- Type the following commands in your terminal:

`  ~ npm install`  
`  ~ npm start`

- Open the project trought the links are provided by the server.

```
   │   Serving!                                        │
   │                                                   │
   │   - Local:            http://localhost:5000       │
   │   - On Your Network:  http://192.168.1.174:5000   │
   │                                                   │
   │   Copied local address to clipboard! 	       │
```

#### **What I learned**

- Run the project into a local server.

- Add sounds from a library adding scripts.

- Implement async and callback functions.

- How to switch to the next screen game with JS and CSS.

- Change style with CSS before and after.

- Create gitignore to hide some unnecessary local folders.

- How to vincule and edit a json file.

#### **Resources**

- For the sounds I used the library [flukeout.simple-sounds](https://github.com/flukeout/simple-sounds).

- The local server is a library from NPM: [serve](https://www.npmjs.com/package/serve).

- Original idea from [then-seconds-math](http://www.mental-math-trainer.com/).
